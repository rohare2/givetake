Givetake is a Unix/Linux tool for sharing files with colleagues.  It provides a
means for sharing files with others without fear of interception.  Sudo and
encryption are used to protect files and file names.

One possible use for givetake is password sharing. By taking advantage of the
notification feature, one could give passwords to their colleagues for use in
emergencies. The password owner would receive and email when the colleague took
the file. Once there is no longer a need for the colleague to have the password
the password can be changed.
